Review of microcontroller organization and architecture;
- Organization of microcontrollers from the PIC18, Cortex-M3, and ESP32 families;
Low-level hardware interaction
- Operation modes, Special Function Registers (SFR) and General Purpose Registers (GPR), addressing modes;
- Timers, interrupts, and stack;
- Programming techniques for microcontrollers: algorithms, flowcharts, assembly language, and C language;
- Development of embedded firmware in C language;
- Internal structures of C programs: memory segmentation, code segments, static variables, stack, and interrupts;
- Function calls in C programs;
- Passing parameters in function calls, through registers and the stack.
- Types of intermediate files in program compilation: source code (.c), header files (.h), assembly files (.asm);
- Creation of executable firmware for microcontrollers;
- Development of projects in embedded systems using I/O ports, serial and parallel communication interfaces, wireless communication, PWM motor control, A/D converters, LCD display, and other peripherals.
