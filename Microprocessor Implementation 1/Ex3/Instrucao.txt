Create a program in assembly that:

➔ Place the origin at address 00h
➔ Start the program with a label
➔ Immediately move 10110111 to ACC and 10000111 to B
➔ Perform logical AND between A and B
➔ Rotate A to the right by 2 bits
➔ Perform the complement of A
➔ Rotate A to the left by 2 bits
➔ Perform logical OR between A and B
➔ Perform XOR between A and B
➔ Perform SWAP of A
➔ Jump to home label
➔ Close the program
